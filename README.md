# ü©∫ Multimodal Healthcare Risk Prediction

## üß≠ Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning workflow for **healthcare risk prediction**.  
The goal is to analyze patient data containing both **clinical indicators** (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol) and **physiological signals** (e.g., heart rate variability, autonomic balance) to identify individuals at higher cardiovascular risk.

The pipeline covers the entire lifecycle, from data exploration to model training, ensuring both **accuracy** and **interpretability**, which are essential in medical applications.

## üìä Results and Visualizations

### üîπ Correlation Heatmap
The heatmap below shows pairwise correlations between numerical features.  
Strong positive correlations (red) and negative correlations (blue) help reveal relationships among physiological and clinical variables.  
For instance, **LF_HF_Ratio** shows a moderate negative correlation with **Power_HF**, indicating inverse HRV behavior between frequency components.

### üîπ Model Performance (Confusion Matrices)
The following confusion matrices compare model predictions on the test set:

- **Left:** Logistic Regression  
- **Right:** Random Forest  

Random Forest achieved slightly better classification on both classes, showing higher true negatives and balanced sensitivity/specificity.
